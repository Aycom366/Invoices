## Overview

### The challenge

  Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete invoices
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit an invoice
- Save draft invoices, and mark pending invoices as paid
- Filter invoices by status (draft/pending/paid)
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

### What I learned
Firstly this projects really taught me so many things i wouldnt even know if i haven't decided to do this project. I learnt about the formik libraries and also how efficient i can use it to manage my form states. Most times, I used the React-Hooks-Form to manage my form state becuase it is similar to Formik handling of state. But when the need of creating dynamic inputs comes in, I realized I need to find a better Library to handle my formstate and that when the idea of using Formik comes in. Including Redux. This is my first time i will be using Redux for state management. Most time I use the useContext API introudced in React 16.8 to handle form data.
